/**

 *    (a) Your name. This is simple
 *    (b) A function: This function will get the length of the string.
 *        Means passing each element into the function that user has
 *        defined, as explained above. And use that length to print a

/**
 * Explanation:
 * When you're designing your API. A callback is nothing but a function
 * that the user of your API will give you. In return, you give your
 * user a 'contract' saying that you'll call her function with X data.
 * 
 * Contract basically means If I ask for this, you give me this.
 * For example, if you ask you mom for more money, she will give you
 * chappal. So, that's a contract, and if we have a contract defined
 * then we behave in that manner only.
 * 
 * Understand that this data can be calculated synchronously or in an
 * asynchronous manner. It doesn't matter as long as you give that data.
