// Will we get an error?
const array = [1,2,3,4]
array = array.push(55)

// Understanding :
// => We will get an error. The "const" declaration creates a constant reference
//    to the array and attempts to reassign that reference to the result of
//    "array.push(55)" will result in a "TypeError".

// => The "const" declaration makes the reference itself constant, so it cannot
//    be changed to point to a different array.

// => The "array.push" method does not return a new array but returns the new
//    length of the array after the "push" operation, which is not valid
//    value for any array reference.
