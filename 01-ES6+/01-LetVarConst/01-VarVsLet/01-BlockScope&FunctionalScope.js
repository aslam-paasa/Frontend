 * 
 * Block Scope:
 * 1. let work only inside 'if-block'. It has a block scope.
 * 2. let keyword is used to declare the variable within the 'if-block'
 *    and the scope of 'b' is limited to 'if-block' only. As a result,
 *    attempting to access 'b' outside of the block will result in
 *    'ReferenceError'.
